# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
This project analyzes the relationship between traffic signs and road accidents in Berlin in 2020.
The study aims to identify which types of traffic signs are most commonly associated with road accidents, and whether certain signs are overrepresented at accident sites.
The findings of this study could be used to inform the development of targeted traffic safety measures aimed at reducing the number of accidents and injuries on Berlin's roads.
The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to improve traffic safety in Berlin.


## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
The analysis of the relationship between traffic signs and road accidents in Berlin in 2020 has the potential to improve traffic safety measures in the city.
By identifying which types of signs are most commonly associated with accidents, measures could be taken such as improving the visibility of certain signs, redesigning intersections or roads with a high incidence of accidents, and increasing awareness of particular road hazards. 
Ultimately, this could lead to a reduction in the number of accidents and injuries on the roads, and an overall improvement in traffic safety in Berlin.
